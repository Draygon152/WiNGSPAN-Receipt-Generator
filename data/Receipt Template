This is Kevin, your friendly neighborhood </font><font size="13" color="#ffd98d00"><loc><a href="showinfo:2//98330748">WiNGSPAN Delivery Services</a></loc></font><font size="13" color="#bfffffff"> Agent!

I am contacting you today to provide you with a receipt for the delivery of ammunition to your ship in </font><font size="13" color="#ffd98d00"><a href="showinfo:5//%10">%11</a></font><font size="13" color="#bfffffff">. We met at %12, which you had chosen as your delivery location, and I promptly delivered you the ammunition that you had requested.<br><br>Unfortunately, it appears that your </font><font size="13" color="#ffd98d00"><a href="showinfo:%7">%8</a></font><font size="13" color="#bfffffff">%9 cargo bay had been damaged prior to delivery, and as such, our rapid-delivery system caused irreparable damage to your ship's structure. We here at </font><font size="13" color="#ffd98d00"><loc><a href="showinfo:2//98330748">WiNGSPAN Delivery Services</a></loc></font><font size="13" color="#bfffffff"> are deeply apologetic for this unfortunate incident, and recommend that proper maintenance procedures are regularly followed prior to any further deliveries to prevent any accidents of this nature from occurring again.

Thank you very much for making use of our services. We hope to see you again soon!
Remember, <i>we're not happy until you're content!</i>

Love,
Kevin
